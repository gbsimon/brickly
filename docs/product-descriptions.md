## One-Liners

## Short (1-2 sentences)
Brickly turns any LEGO set inventory into a clean, touch-friendly checklist. Track parts with a tap, stay organized, and keep building--online or offline.

## Medium (3-5 sentences)
Brickly is your rebuild companion for LEGO sets of any size. Search a set, open the parts list, and tap to track what you've found. Filters, color groups, and hide-completed keep big inventories manageable. It's offline-first, so your progress is safe even without Wi-Fi, and it syncs across devices when you're back online.

## Long (6-8 sentences)
Brickly makes rebuilding LEGO sets feel simple and satisfying. It turns a dense parts inventory into a friendly checklist you can use right at the build table. Search and add a set, then tap to count pieces as you find them. Filters, sorting, and color-grouped sections keep large inventories from getting overwhelming. Hide completed parts to focus on what's left and keep your momentum. Brickly works offline and syncs your progress across devices when you reconnect. Whether you're restoring a vintage set or rebuilding from a mixed bin, it keeps you moving.
